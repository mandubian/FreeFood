# Veal scallop with mushroom sauce

> Great classic of french cooking but also in Europe as you can find it almost everywhere.



## Ingredients

- a veal scallop per person not too thin
- mushrooms of Paris (crimini mushrooms) sliced (canned is often far easier)
- 2/3 shallots, finely chopped
- butter
- whipping cream (not light)
- 3/4 cup dry white wine (nothing sweet or too fruity - good example: Edelzwicker (Alsace) or Chardonnay)
- salt / pepper
- optional: coat (very lightly) veal in flour

## Challenge

- If you use fresh mushrooms, cook them in another skillet than veal and mix with shallots before adding cream
- Do not use light cream, you will need twice the quantity for a worse taste
- Do not burn shallots, just make them "sweat" in butter
- You can also remove shallots from skillet meanwhile you grill the scallop & reput them in it for sauce
- The veal mustn't be grilled too long to be soft
- The sauce must be prepared in the same skillet as the veal
- The veal mustn't stay in the sauce and should be kept hot in foil or oven
- **DO NOT BOIL THE CREAM**, it's bad for taste & health: just eat it softly while stirring
- reduce the sauce until obtaining creamy texture, not too liquid, not too solid



## Side dish

- white rice
- pasta



## Wine

- Same white wine as the one used for cooking if good
- dry wine (not too dry, not too fruity):
    - Chardonnay from Bourgogne (Meursault, Chablis, etc...)
    - Riesling or white Pinot from Alsace
    - White Sauvignon from Sancerre



## Other ideas

- want something exotic? Add saffron/curry to cream
- replace veal by chicken or pork
- add a bit of lemon with wine
- etc...
